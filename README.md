## 🎯 Problem Statement

### The Challenge

RGPV students face several interconnected challenges in their academic journey:

1. **Fragmented Communication**: Students struggle to connect with seniors and peers across different branches and years
2. **Knowledge Isolation**: Valuable academic insights and experiences remain siloed within small groups
3. **Lack of Mentorship**: Limited access to senior student guidance for academic and career-related queries
4. **Information Overload**: Difficulty in finding relevant answers to specific academic questions
5. **No Centralized Platform**: Absence of a dedicated space for RGPV students to collaborate and share knowledge

### The Impact

These challenges result in:
- **Repeated Questions**: Same queries asked across multiple platforms without consolidated answers
- **Missed Opportunities**: Students missing out on valuable guidance from experienced seniors
- **Academic Stress**: Increased anxiety due to lack of accessible help and mentorship
