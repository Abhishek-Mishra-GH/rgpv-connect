## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated orange (#FF7043), for a sense of energy, warmth, and focus.
- Background color: Desaturated orange (#FAF2F0). It keeps the design warm but visually calm, providing a neutral surface on which UI elements will stand out clearly.
- Accent color: Analogous and desaturated coral-pink (#FFB2A6). It contrasts softly with the primary, and suggests collaboration and interpersonal warmth.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, for a blend of computerized precision and neutral readability.
- Modern and consistent icon set, using clear, geometric shapes.
- Clean and structured layout with clear separation of content sections.
- Subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience (e.g., smooth scrolling, hover effects).
